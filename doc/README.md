## Overview

- Prompt Bouncer can be used as a Python library or as a FastAPI REST API, both are outlined below.
- The REST API can also be run through Docker.
- Several convenience scripts are provided and are outlined below also.
- Please see the technical documentation at the base of the ReadMe for an in-depth look at the threat assessment mechanism in Prompt Bouncer. 

## Requirements

- Prompt Bouncer should work with any version of Python. `3.8+` but `3.11` is recommended.
- Prompt Bouncer needs an Open AI key to operate. Internally the `GTP4-o` model is used as it is cheap and fast.
- Prompt Bouncer does not need a GPU and will work on most shared hosting environmentrs where Python is available, as well as on any cloud provider where Docker is available.

## Setup

- You should create a `.env` in the root of your project and place your OpenAI API key in there.

```
# OpenAI API
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-blahblahblah
```
- Prompt Bouncer will pick it up from here.
- Alternatively, set up the usual `OPENAI_API_KEY` environmental variable.
