# Overview

Prompt Bouncer is a tool that helps AI developers stop prompt-based attacks by providing a threat assessment of any incoming prompt. Prompt Bouncer acts like security personnel at the door of your AI system, checking e
very incoming prompt to ensure it is safe before allowing it through. It stops anything undesirable from getting in by looking for threats. Prompt Bouncer will create a recommendation on whether a prompt should be allowed through or not.
